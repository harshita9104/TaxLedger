# TaxLedger
This project aims to develop a blockchain-based transaction system that ensures secure payments and automates tax collection. This system integrates with MetaMask wallets for both customers and businesses and directly transfers the applicable tax to the government. The project enhances transparency  and provides real-time updates on transaction status.

Key Features:

MetaMask Integration: Secure payment process using MetaMask wallets.
Automated Tax Collection: The system automatically calculates and transfers the tax to the government's wallet.
Real-Time Transaction Status: Immediate updates on payment and tax transfer statuses.
Invoice Generation: Automatic invoice generation upon successful transaction and tax payment.
Flowchart:
Business: Displays the transaction details, including product list and total cost.
Customer: MetaMask wallet opens for payment.
Business: Receives the payment, updates the account balance, and sends tax to the government.
Government: Receives the tax amount in its MetaMask wallet.
Business: Once both payment and tax statuses are green, the system generates and prints the invoice.
